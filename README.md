# NodeJS Crash Course

This repo is a NodeJS crash course that includes references for node built-in modules like path, fs, os, http, and more. In addition, it includes an http server build from scratch in vanilla js. 
It was built while watching the [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/@TraversyMedia) [Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBNz5xF-Kx4). It's an awesome tutorial, definetly make sure to check it out!

### Experience

What I learned: 

- I tried NodeJS for the first time
- Understood what `package.json`, `node_modules` and other files stood for
- How to init a basic node project which can include different libs/frameworks like React, VueJS, etc.
- How to use NodeJS built-in libs: path, fs, os, http, events, uuid
